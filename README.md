## 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 📌 Task 3 – AI & ML Internship Project  
This project implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** using the `Housing.csv` dataset to predict house prices based on features like `area` and `bedrooms`.

---

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is `Housing.csv` which contains housing-related data including:

- `area` – size of the house in square feet  
- `bedrooms` – number of bedrooms  
- `price` – target variable (price of the house)

---

### 📌 Objectives

- Load and preprocess a real-world dataset
- Implement Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, and R²
- Visualize the regression results
- Interpret regression coefficients

---

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

### ✅ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or upload the files to Google Colab
2. Upload `Housing.csv` when prompted
3. Run the full script from top to bottom
4. View predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualization

---

### 📊 Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics help determine the model's accuracy and prediction quality.

---

### 📉 Sample Output

```
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 53426.34
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 4589219234.56
R² Score: 0.79

Intercept: 12690.54
area: 121.34
bedrooms: 215678.90
```

---

### 📈 Visualization

The regression line is plotted to show the relationship between `area` and `price`, helping visualize how the model fits the data.

---

### 📚 Interview Prep Q&A

This project prepares you to answer:
- What assumptions does linear regression make?
- How do you interpret coefficients?
- What’s the difference between MAE and MSE?
- When is R² a good measure of accuracy?
